Q-2 Write a difference between var ,let , and const

1 - var 
	
	The scope of var variable is global when it is declared outside a function.
	This means when variable  can declared with var outside function block this will be available for whole window.
	If you can declared a variable with var inside a function then this can be accessable only within function.

	var person="abc";
	function func1()
	{
		var emp="pqr";
	}

	var person can be declared as globally while var emp can be inside a function so we cannot access it outside.


2 - let

	It is used for variable declaration.
	let is block scoped.
	Whenever we declare a variable with let the scope of that variable is only in that function.
	cannot access outside a block.
	It will throw an error.

	let city="pune";
	let time =4;

	if(time >3)
	{
		let country="India";
		console.log(country);           //India
	}

	console.log(country);                          // India not found



3 - const 

	Variables declared with const it maintain a constat values you cannot changenit.
	const is block scoped.
	The value cannot be re-declared or updated.

	const city="Mumbai";

	city="Solapur";           // throw an error
